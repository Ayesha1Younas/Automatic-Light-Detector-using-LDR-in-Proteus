# Automatic-Light-Detector-using-LDR-in-Proteus
Project of Automatic Light Detector using LDR in Proteus.
Its a really exciting project in Proteus in which a very simple circuit is detecting the light and turning the LED on/off according to the mechanism. The resistance of Light Detector Resistor can be veried so that you can check the working. Below 5.1R, LED remains off. Once the resistance increas to 5.1, the LED is turned on.
